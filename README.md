This is a small tool I wrote to brute-force a tire search engine.

I was looking for 155r12 tires for a classic Mini, but could not find them using the search engine provided, as the sidewall height ratio wasn't specified in the old-style tire sizes. I knew that their database had 155r12 tires in it somewhere, as I could find one via Googling their site, but I didn't know if there were more 155r12 options or how to get to them.

This tool just tries every combination of sidewall ratios they provided, but unfortunately no results were found. I'm putting the source up because it might be useful for other oddball size searches, and you never know.
